My recent search is on the non-Hermitian physics which can described the open quantum system effectively. I'm interested on topological property on toplogicla system with non-Hermicity which is defferent from the conventional topological system. In order to dicuss that what's happened to physics observables with dissapation. I'm also interested on superconductor and graphene physics.

A gauge invariant is the phase change around the boundary of the magnetic unit cell.\nWavefunction would be:\n$$ u_{k_1k_2}(x,y) = \\vert u_{k_1k_2}(x,y) \\vert \\exp[i\\theta_{k_1k_2}(x,y)] $$\none has\n$$ p = \\frac{-1}{2 \\pi} \\int d\\mathbf{l} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\theta_{k_1k_2}(x,y)}{d\\mathbf{l}} $$\nWhere it integral around the boundary of the magnetic unit cell.It shows that is gauge-invariant although $$\\theta_{k_1k_2}(x,y)$$ denpends on gauge. If we go around clockwise with a small circle which contains the zero, the corresponding arrow rotates once either clockwise or counterclockwise which means that can regard a zero of wavefunction as vortex which has a vorticity either 1 or -1(This is a topological constraint because the vorticity in the magnetic unit cell is independent of a particular potential chosen).\nLinear Response Formula for the Hall Conductance # For the Schrodinger euqation with periodical potential, the Hall conductance can expressed as:\n$$ \\sigma^{(\\alpha)}_{xy} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int d^2k[\\nabla_k \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}(k_1,k_2)]_3, $$\nwhere the $$[;]_3$$ represents the third component of the vector.\nNotice that the integration is over the magnetic Brillouin zone: $$0 \\leq k_1 \\leq 2\\pi/qa, 0 \\leq k_2 \\leq 2\\pi/b$$. It means that the magnetic Brillouin zone is topological torus $$T^2$$ rather than the rectangular in $$\\mathbf{k}$$- space. Since that the torus does not has the boundary, the application of the Stoke\u0026rsquo;s theorem would give $$\\sigma^{(\\alpha)}_{xy} = 0$$ if $$\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}(k_1,k_2)$$ is uniquely defined on the entire torus $$T^2$$. Therefore, the non-trivial $$\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}(k_1,k_2)$$ can only be constructed when global topology of the base space is contractible.\nTo understand the topology of the $$\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}(k_1,k_2)$$, we should cosider the gauge transformation of a special kind. Let the function $$u_{k_1,k_2}(x,y)e^{if(k_1,k_2)}$$ satisfies the Schrodinger equation, where $$f(k_1,k_2)$$ is an arbitrary smooth function.\nIntroducing the phase transition:\n$$ u\u0026rsquo;{k_1,k_2}(x,y) = u{k_1,k_2}\\exp[if(k_1,k_2)] $$\nThe physical quantity remains under this transformation. Therefore, the corresponding transformation of the vector potential is given by:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\u0026rsquo;(k_1,k_2) = \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}(k_1,k_2) + i\\nabla_k f(k_1,k_2) $$\nThe non-trivial topology arise when the phase of the wavefunction cannot be determined uniquely globally and smoothly in the entire magnetic Brillouin zone. We knowe that the overall phase for each state vector $$\\vert u_{k_1,k_2} \\rangle$$ can be chosen arbitrary. However, it\u0026rsquo;s not enough to fix the phase on the entire magnetic Brillouin zone, if there some state vector vanishes. This kind of vanishing can be regarded as the vortex in Brillouin zone.\nAt the boundary, we have a phase mismatch:\n$$ \\vert u^{II}{k_1k_2}\\rangle = \\exp[i\\xi(k_1,k_2)]\\vert u^{I}{k_1k_2}\\rangle $$\nwhere $$\\xi(k_1,k_2)$$ is a smooth function of $$(k_1,k_2)$$ on $$\\partial H$$.\nThe non-trivial topology of $$\\vert u_{k_1,k_2}\\rangle$$ is carried to that of $$\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}(k_1,k_2)$$. The phase mismatch of state can induces the following relation between $$\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}I(k_1,k_2)$$ and $$\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}{II}(k_1,k_2)$$ on $$\\partial H$$.\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}_{II}(k_1,k_2) = \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}_I(k_1,k_2) + i\\nabla_k \\xi (k_1,k_2) $$\nTherefore, the Hall conductance can be:\n$$ \\sigma^{\\alpha}{xy} = \\frac{e^2}{h} \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int{\\partial H} d\\mathbf{k} \\cdot [\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}1(k_1,k_2)-\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}{II}(k_1,k_2)] $$\nwhere the integration represents the line integral on the mismatching boundary.
